							<p>My name is Araceli, pronounced (Are-ah-cell-lee). It means heavens alter in Greek; although, I'm not Greek.  I learned the meaning of my name thanks to the power of the internet, yeay technology.  Before I discovered the search engine (yes I have aged myself) people would ask me if I knew what my name meant and I would say 'no'.  One man told me that in Latin, Ara meant bird, so for years I thought my name meant bird (something). I would like to say he was on the right path, I guess...</p>
							
							<p>I love traveling, being outdoors and staying active.  I have visited almost all 50 states and 10 countries abroad, some more than once.  A 5k is a normal run for me and a short bike ride is 20 miles.  I'm not a very strong swimmer but with all the shark and gator attacks and amoeba in the lakes I'm okay with that.	Paddleboards, kayaks and boats make for a perfect day on the water.  Hiking is on the top of my favorite things to do but living in Florida puts a damper on that list.  There's pros and cons to everything.</p>
